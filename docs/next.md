We plan to edit a series of illustrated manuscripts of Germanicus Caesar's Latin translation of the *Phaenomena* of Aratus.  This hexameter poem was a popular introduction to astronomy, emphasizing how to recognize and interpret the constellations, from its composition to early modern times.

The first manuscript we'll edit is also from the collection of the Bern Burgerbibliothek.  In addition to the Latin text and illustrations of the constellations, it includes a series of scholarly footnotes, or *scholia*, that we will also edit.  You can browse [citable images of Bern 88](../bern88-thumbs).

Here's folio 3 recto:
