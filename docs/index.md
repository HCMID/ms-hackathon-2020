## Welcome!

1.  Find your way to Levis Browsing Room, and organize your school's group in teams with one of our team leaders.
2.  Verify that one (or more) of each team's computers  is [fully configured](preparation).
2.  Download a `zip` file with [data and templates for editing](https://github.com/HCMID/hackathon2020-template).  (Look for green "Clone or download" button.)

## What is our manuscripts hackathon?

-   A free, one-day workshop for secondary-school teachers and students.  (Teachers can receive professional development points.)
-   You'll learn how to read and edit Latin manuscripts.
-   No prior experience with manuscripts or editing is required. Students should currently be taking a Latin class (any level).
-   We'll create a digital edition of a cool illustrated 9th-century Latin  manuscript with a poem about the constellations (Germanicus Caesar's *Aratea*.)
- You bring a laptop and enthusiasm: we'll provide training and coffee breaks (and occasional examples of rhetorical figures like [zeugma](http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-zeugma.html)).
-  Lunch and snacks at coffee breaks will be provided.
-  We plan to submit a complete edition of the Bern manuscript's *Aratea* to a new publication series, *Holy Cross Digital Diplomatic  Editions*.  If our work is accepted, your name will apear in the list of contributing editors!  (The new series will be published as part of the Holy Cross Libraryâ€™s digital Institutional Repository.)
