## What is our manuscripts hackathon?

-   A free, one-day workshop for secondary-school teachers and students.  (Teachers can receive professional development points.)
-   You'll learn how to read and edit Latin manuscripts.
-   No prior experience with manuscripts or editing is required. Students should currently be taking a Latin class (any level).
-   We'll create a digital edition of a cool illustrated 9th-century Latin  manuscript with a poem about the constellations (Germanicus Caesar's *Aratea*.)
- You bring a laptop and enthusiasm: we'll provide training and coffee breaks (and occasional examples of rhetorical figures like [zeugma](http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-zeugma.html)).
-  You may bring a bag lunch, or purchase lunch at the Kimball Dining Hall for $10.
-  Our work will be submitted to a new publication series, *Holy Cross Digital Diplomatic  Editions*.  If our work is accepted, your name will apear in the list of contributing editors!  (The new series will be published as part of the Holy Cross Libraryâ€™s digital Institutional Repository.)
