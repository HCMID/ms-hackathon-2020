You can join our hackathon no matter what your previous experience with Latin. At the Holy Cross Manuscripts, Inscriptions and Documents Club, we do all our work in teams.  For the hackathon, we'll place you in a team with other students who have a similar background in Latin.  Everyone will learn how to read a thousand-year-old manuscript.

If you're interested in continuing to work with us reading and editing manuscripts, we'll talk with you about how you can stay in touch with us, and suggest some ways you can form a team at your school.

If you're interested in computers, we can also suggest some ways you can use those skills to contribute.

And youâ€™re always welcome to visit the Manuscripts, Inscriptions and Documents Club at Holy Cross. We meet every Friday afternoon when school is in session from 2:00 until at least 5:00.
