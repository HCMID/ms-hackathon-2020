**Hannah Nguyen** '19 conceived and organized this event.  **Karen Harney**, Academic Coordinator of the Department of Classics,  provided invaluable administrative support and help.

The many volunteers of the [Holy Cross Manuscripts, Inscriptions and Documents Club](http://hcmid.github.io/) made it possible.

For refreshments and coffee breaks, we thank the [Classics Department of the College of the Holy Cross](https://www.holycross.edu/academics/programs/classics), the largest and most active undergraduate Classics program in the United States.
