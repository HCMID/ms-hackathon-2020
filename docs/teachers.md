As far as possible, we'll try to form small teams that allow teachers to work with groups of their own students.  We want to make sure that early Latin students have a teacher on their team at all times.  More advanced students might be placed in teams on their own, but we'll give you opportunities to jump in with all your students if you bring a large enough group to form more than one team.


Forms with further information will be available at the workshop for you to leave name and contact information if you are interested in receiving  continuing education credits for this workshop.
