Small teams (3-6) of participants will work with experienced Holy Cross students and alumni to edit part of a Latin manuscript from high-resolution digital images that are freely available over the internet. We expect that before the day is over, we will have completed a substantially complete edition Germanicus Caesar's *Aratea* (part of Latin manuscript 88 in the Bern Burgerbibliothek, in Bern, Switzerland).

The text of our digital edition will be keyed to images of the text, and will be tested with scripts that analyze the Latin text and the formating of the edition.

Once all automated tests are passed, we will publish the edition in the Holy Cross Library's digital Institutional Repository.  All hackathon participants will be named as contributing editors.
