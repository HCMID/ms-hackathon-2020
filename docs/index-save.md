## What is our manuscripts hackathon?

-   A free, one-day workshop for secondary-school teachers and students.
-   You'll learn how to read and edit Latin manuscripts.
-   No prior experience with manuscripts or editing is required. Students should currently be taking a Latin class (any level).
-   We'll create a digital edition of a cool [9th-century Latin  manuscript with illustrated allegorical stories about animals](thumbs) (lions, mandrakes, snakes, pelicans and more).
- You bring a laptop and enthusiasm: we'll provide lunch, snacks and training (and occasional examples of rhetorical figures like [zeugma](http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-zeugma.html)).
-  Our work will be submitted to a new publication series, *Holy Cross Digital Diplomatic  Editions*.  If our work is accepted, your name will apear in the list of contributing editors!  (The new series will be published as part of the Holy Cross Libraryâ€™s digital Institutional Repository, [CrossWorks](http://crossworks.holycross.edu/hc-dde).)
