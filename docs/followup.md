We'll let you how we progress on a complete edition of the Bern *Aratea*.

We'll suggest some ideas about how you could form a team at your school.

You're always welcome to visit the Manuscripts, Inscriptions and Documents Club at Holy Cross.  We meet every Friday afternoon when school is in session from 2:00 until at least 5:00.  You can meet Holy Cross students and see what kinds of projects they're working on.  If you're a prospective student, we can also arrange tours, class room visits, and interviews with Holy Cross faculty members in Classics.
